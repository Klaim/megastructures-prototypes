Proto 1:
--------


- Most entity-component-system library do not allow copy of the whole component data.
    -> Maybe make my own ecs system/library (probalby using "plf-colony/hive")
    -> Maybe work without value semantics?
    -> Maybe not use an ECS?

- Coroutine generator implementations are not all equal - chose them well.
    -> Use `tl::generator` until we have `std::generator`
